Remove unnecessary function definitions. Only keep the functions that are actually needed and used in the codebase.\n2. Consider refactoring the remaining functions to reduce redundancy and improve code maintainability.\n3.

To identify the top performing products, we need to calculate the total sales for each product and rank them.\n\nHere's how we can do this:\n\n1. Filter the sales data for the last quarter.\n2. Group the data by product_id and sum the amounts to get the total sales for each product.\n3. Rank the products based on their total sales.\n\nLet's start by writing the SQL query to filter the sales data for the last quarter.\n\n```python\n# Get the current date\nfrom datetime import datetime\ncurrent_date = datetime.now().date()\n\n# Calculate the date 3 months ago\nquarter_start = current_date - datetime.timedelta(days=90)\n\n# Convert the dates to the format in the database\nquarter_start_str = quarter_start.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n\n# SQL query to filter sales for the last quarter\nsql_query = f\"\"\"\nSELECT *\nFROM sales\nWHERE date >= '{quarter_start_str}'\n\"\"\"\n\n# Exec",

Next, I will filter the Python files to find those that contain database connection logic. This can be done by searching for specific keywords or patterns related to database connections, such as \"psycopg2\", \"sqlite3\", \"mysql-connector-python\", etc.\n\n```python\ndb_files = []\nfor file in python_files:\n    with open(file, 'r') as f:\n        content = f.read()\n        if 'psycopg2' in content or 'sqlite3' in content or 'mysql-connector-python' in content:\n            db_files.append(file)\n```\n\n3.

This indicates a consistent issue across multiple instances or nodes in the distributed system.\n\n2. Identifying Root Causes:\n   a. Systemic Issue: The consistent error message and stack trace suggest a systemic issue rather than a random or isolated problem. This could be due to a bug in the codebase, a configuration issue, or a problem with the environment.\n\n   b. Code Bug: The repetitive error message and stack trace could indicate a bug in the code that is being triggered consistently. This could be due to a logical error, an infinite loop, or a null pointer exception.\n\n   c. Configuration Issue: The error could be due to incorrect configuration settings. This could include database connection settings, network settings, or any other system-wide configuration.\n\n   d. Environmental Issue: The problem could be due to the environment in which the sys",
